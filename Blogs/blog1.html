<strong> How to find happiness: 9 simple and helpful tips </strong> <br>
<br>
<br>
Life is all about the pursuit of happiness, but how do you really go about finding it? Discover 9 habits to help you build a happier life.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Practice mindfulness and meditation</strong>
<br>
One of the best ways to find happiness is to stay in the moment and really feel your life as you’re living it. Learning to stay present in the moment can lead to better overall happiness and that’s where mindfulness comes in.
<br>
<br>
<strong> 2. Write down your feelings</strong>
<br>
Human beings feel so many feelings over the course of our lives, and sometimes many feelings over the course of a single day. Sometimes figuring out what we’re feeling is hard, but talking about them or writing down how we feel can help.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Practice decluttering</strong>
<br>
Keeping your space clean can help you feel happier. Studies  have shown that those who describe their homes as messy, cluttered, or dirty tend to feel more depressive and melancholy.
<br>
<br>
<strong> 4. Practice gratitude</strong>
<br>
What we focus our attention on can really impact our overall emotional experience. Rather than focusing on what you may be lacking or what feels like it’s missing, try making a list of all the things you’re grateful for. It doesn’t mean you can’t wish to have more or be more successful, but practicing gratitude helps you stay in the moment where you can celebrate the abundance you already have in your life.
<br>
<br>
<strong> 5. Set attainable goals</strong>
<br>
Another way to boost self-esteem is to watch yourself achieve mini-successes. If you have a to-do list that’s a mile long with difficult and complex goals then you’ll feel like a failure every time you don’t achieve one of those goals. By contrast there is power in watching yourself achieve smaller steps more consistently. An example of this might look like setting a goal to go for a long walk or run once or twice a week rather than insisting that you wake up tomorrow and train for a marathon.
<br>
<br>
<strong> 6. Allow yourself to feel the joys in life fully</strong>
<br>
This falls under the category of being mindful and staying in the moment. Even during challenging times there are plenty of moments of joy to be had. Maybe you’ve found yourself in a tough spot where you’re struggling with work, or in between jobs. If you’re in that situation but you still find yourself abundant with friends and family who love you then focus on the joy in that. By focusing on the existing joys you’re experiencing you keep your focus positive which can help you feel happier overall.
<br>
<br>
<strong> 7. Don’t forget to breathe</strong>
<br>
Studies show that deep, mindful breathing can help reduce physical tension, as well as emotional stress and anxiety. The less tense you feel, the happier you’ll be. While deep breathing can help you to feel more grounded and centered, there are a few other breath practices that can really help boost happiness.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy.
