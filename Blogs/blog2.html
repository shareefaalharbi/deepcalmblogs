	While it can be tempting to turn up our noses at something as basic sounding as counting our blessings, there’s genuine, science-backed connections between gratitude and our overall happiness and wellbeing. 
Studies have shown that something as simple as counting your blessings can significantly affect your mental health, mood, relationships, and even your physical health.

Gratitude practices are a perfect partner to mindfulness, reminding us that sometimes, happiness is about recognizing and cherishing the good already in our lives rather than focusing on what we’re lacking.

What is gratitude meditation?
Gratitude meditation is taking a moment to pause, breathe, and reflect on the things you're thankful for. It's a mindfulness practice where you intentionally focus on appreciating the good things in life, whether big, like a promotion, or small, like your morning coffee being just right.
Gratitude meditation gently guides you to focus on the good things you have. Not the lottery-winning moments but the everyday, simple joys. And as you make gratitude a habit, it can influence how you see the world. Instead of dreading the day, you begin looking for things to be thankful for. Gratitude meditation in your morning routine can shift your day from mundane to meaningful
